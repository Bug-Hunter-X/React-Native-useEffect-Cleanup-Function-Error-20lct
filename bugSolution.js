To fix this, you need to check if the component is still mounted before accessing its state or props in the cleanup function.  This typically involves adding a `mounted` state variable and updating it appropriately:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(true);
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      if (mounted) {
        setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      setMounted(false);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

By checking `mounted` before performing any operations on state, we ensure that we avoid errors after the component unmounts.
