This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  This often happens when the cleanup function tries to access a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  For instance:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    // ... some code that updates state ...
  }, 1000);

  return () => {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    // ...this is where an error could occur if this code tries to update state after component unmount...
  };
}, []);
```
